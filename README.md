# HotPot Exam Solver

This solver is for a very old HotPot plugin from learning portal MOODLE.

I do not know a version of the MOODLE nor HotPot, but this is how look like the version I test this on.

You can find it as browser extension on [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moodle-exam-solver/ogmonhnolabdebjebfafnhnkemikgaja).
